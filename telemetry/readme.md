# Recruiting telemetry

> ⚠️ This document is fairly technical to maintain brevity, if you have **any** questions ask your recruiter or come visit us at floor -2 of Povo 2.

## Abstract

From the project you chose, we will test your programming skills in C/C++, how do you approach a problem and how you solved it.  
Remember that the choices you have made must have a foundation, and based on that maybe an easier solution could be preferred to a more complex one.

## Projects

You can find two folders.

- [project_1](./project_1/readme.md): Is focused for guys who applied for the UI part of our telemetry software.
- [project_2](./project_2/readme.md): If you applied for the low level part of the telemetry this project is for you.
