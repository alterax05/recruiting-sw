# Recruiting telemetry

From the project you chose, we will test your programming skills in C/C++, how do you approach a problem and how you solved it.  
Remember that the choices you have made must have a foundation, and based on that mybe an easier solution could be preferred to a more complex one.  
If you have some issues on the project feel free to contact your recruiter or coming directly to our laboratory at Povo 2, Floor -2.

## Projects

You can find two folders.

- [project_1](./project_1/readme.md): Is focused for guys who applied for the UI part of our telemetry software.
- [project_2](./project_2/readme.md): If you applied for the lowlevel part of the telemetry this project is for you.
